# Week 4 - OOP in Python: Class Inheritance & Iterators

### TASK 1: Dictionary

1. Write a program to create dictionary of choice. Display your output.  
2. Use an built-in function `dict()` to create dictionary. Display your output. 
3. Write a program to create a nested dictionary. Display your output. 
4. Write a program to create an empty dictionary then perform the following. 
  a. To the empty dictionary add element. Display your output. 
  b. Use the built-in `update()` method to update your dictionary. Display  your output. 
5. Write a program to access element from a dictionary. Display your output. 
6. Similar to Question 5 write a program to access element from a nested dictionary. Display your output. 
7. Write a program to remove element from a nested dictionary. Display your output. 
  a. Write a program using `del Dict` method to delete the entire dictionary. 
  b. Write a program using `pop()` method to delete the entire dictionary. 
  c. Write a program using `clear()` method to delete the entire dictionary. 


### TASK 2: Function  
1. Write a program to using the `def` keyword to create a function. Display your output. 
2. Write a program to create a simple function to check whether the number passed as an argument to the function is even or odd. 
3. Write a program to illustrates Default arguments. 
4. Write a program to pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols using two special symbols: 
  a. `*args` (Non-Keyword Arguments) Display your output 
  b. `**kwargs` (Keyword Arguments) Display your output


### TASK 3: Class Iteration & Class Iterator
1. Write a program to make a class then create Iterator class for it. 
2. Give your opinion why should we make a Custom class Iterable? 
3. Create an object of class in (qestion1) and add some elements in it and evaluate the 
following:  
  a. Check if the class is Iterable by calling `iter()` function on the object of the 
class. What is the output? 
  b. Try to iterate over the classâ€™s object using `for` loop. What is output? 
4. Write a custom program to make your class Iterable (in Question 1 above). 
5. Create an Iterator class by overriding `__next__()` function inside your class.  
6. From question 5 above iterate over the contents of your class using for loop. 
7. Write a program that Iterate over an Iterable (list) using `for` and `while` loops.
